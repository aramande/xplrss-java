XplRSS
======

Java version of my RSS reader.

XplRSS is a pun on Explores and is pronounced that way because of that.
It's not meant to be used by anyone but me, but if you want to try it out, feel free to enjoy the bugs.

About
-----
XplRSS was based on the fact that there were no good readers that grouped feeds in a tree-like manner.
When I'm browsing my feeds, I don't care much for 1-level categories, or even two. 
I wanted a feed to be able to exist in multiple levels of categories, where a higher category would 
list all the entries of the underlying feeds. 

The other problem I wanted to try to solve was the appearance of updated entries, especially from youtube,
where an edited description is cause for a new entry. I wanted this to be an option to disable on a feed.
Of course, I never got to the point where there were options, but the thought was there.

Installation
------------
Can't remember, I'm sure it's javac something and then java something else. Have fun with that. :P
